This is code for aligning and summing Terzan 5 pulsar data.

For example, to sum L-band data from a particular directory,
modify then call the script ``make_summed_profs_Lband.py``

See below for Tim Pennucci's description of Pulse Portraiture.

===================

What it is:
    -a wideband pulsar timing code written in python. It uses an extension of
        Joe Taylor's FFTFIT algorithm (Taylor 1992) to simultaneously measure a
        phase (TOA) and dispersion measure (DM).  It is to be used with
        PSRCHIVE-compatible folded archives (PSRFITS format).

Why:
    -The motivation behind writing this software was to develop a wideband
        measurement routine for high-precision pulsar timing, and it makes up a
        chunk of Tim Pennucci's Ph.D. thesis.  Algorithm development and coding
        help was provided by Paul Demorest and Scott Ransom.

The technical description of this work is:
    -Pennucci, Demorest, & Ransom (2014), "Elementary Wideband Timing of Radio
        Pulsars", ApJ, 790, 93.

Requirements:
    -PSRCHIVE, compiled with the python-interface enabled,
    -at least numpy 1.7.1 & scipy 0.12.0, and
    -lmfit is required for portrait modelling.

In short:
    -pplib contains all functions and classes needed for the fitting scripts.
    -ppgauss is a command-line utility to build gaussian-component model
        portraits.
    -pptoas is a command-line utility to measure TOAs and DMs.
    -ppalign is a command-line utility to average homogeneous data by measuring
        phases and DMs.
    -Both ppgauss and pptoas can be imported into ipython for additional
        flexibility of use.
    -***See examples/README for simple command-line use.***
    -Run and examine examples/example.py for a more in-depth demonstration.

Other:
    -Code improvements are underway, as is a broad application to IPTA pulsars
        of interest.  Suggestions and additional development are welcome
